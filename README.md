# Mac-Utility

Script created by Amon so that the machine of his love can act with full force.

The execution of the Cleaning does not affect any library or pre-established configuration, since it performs the cleaning without using the Sudo command.

Always running in Administrator mode.

1st way to run the Script:

-> chmod +x Faxina.sh (makes it executable)
-> ./Faxina.sh (runs the Script)

2nd way to run the Script:

-> bash Faxina.sh (already runs the file without the need to modify the file)

I hope you like it, I learned how to do it so I can help you with the crashes.

I love you
